# Randomize Algorithms

> A randomized algorithm is a technique that uses a source of randomness as part of its logic. It is typically used to reduce either the running time, or time complexity; or the memory used, or space complexity, in a standard algorithm. The algorithm works by generating a random number, r, within a specified range of numbers, and making decisions based on r's value. -- [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/wiki/randomized-algorithms-overview/)
